# Tampi

Tampi is a tool meant to assist menstruation tracking through the use of Lampi hardware and an iOS application. Using the lamp, users will be able to visually track their, or a friends’, menstrual cycle through a color key. Additionally, users will be able to use the Lampi for casual application through preset and custom colors which can be controlled through either the iOS app or the lamps Kivy touchscreen. 

We see this product as a chance to encourage destigmatizing menstruation: a topic that’s usually avoided because it’s deemed as “uncomfortable” or “inappropriate”. It can be used between family members, friends, or partners to stay updated without directly needing to ask. By creating a means to keep up with a connection’s cycle, Tampi owners can better understand their needs and, if needed, adjust to them. It creates a space where menstruation can become more normalized, as it’s a habitual part of life for half of the world’s population, and turn into something that can potentially be seen as fun.

The iOS application will be implemented using Swift, with userdata being stored locally with CoreData. The application will communicate with Lampi via bluetooth, and Lampi will include a simple Kivy touchscreen interface.
